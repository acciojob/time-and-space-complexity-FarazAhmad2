    <h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity gauges an algorithm's efficiency by evaluating how its runtime scales with input size. Expressed through Big O notation, it enables quick comparisons, helping identify algorithms optimal for varied tasks. Understanding time complexity is paramount for crafting efficient algorithms and making informed choices in algorithmic design and implementation.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>, akin to time complexity, evaluates an algorithm's efficiency by measuring its memory usage as input scales. It quantifies how additional data affects memory requirements. Described through Big O notation, commonly denoted as O(n), it facilitates comparisons, aiding in selecting algorithms that optimize both time and space resources.</p>
